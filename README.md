# RAG-Based-Question-Generation-on-PyTorch
Wikipedia Question Generator This project retrieves content from Wikipedia and generates questions based on that content using a pre-trained T5 model. The user provides a Wikipedia page name, the content is fetched, and potential answers are extracted. Questions are then generated around these answers.
